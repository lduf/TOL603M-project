# Abstract:

Deceptive text is a pervasive issue in various forms of communication, ranging from phishing emails to fake news. This study conducts a comparative analysis of five different datasets containing deceptive and genuine text samples. The datasets include phishing emails, fake news, job scams, political statements, and product reviews. We employ various analytical techniques, such as text length distribution, word frequency, and t-SNE visualizations, to uncover patterns and trends within and across these datasets. Our findings provide valuable insights into the nature of deceptive text across different domains and can help inform future research and the development of more effective detection methods.

# Introduction

Deception has become a significant problem in various areas of communication, including phishing emails, fake news, job scams, political statements, and product reviews. Identifying deceptive patterns across these domains can help in understanding their commonalities and differences, and subsequently, in developing more effective detection methods. In this study, we analyze five datasets containing deceptive and genuine text samples to uncover trends and patterns within and across these domains.

# Materials and Methods

## 1. Datasets

We used five datasets containing samples from the following domains: - Phishing Emails - Fake News - Job Scams - Political Statements - Amazon Product Reviews

Each dataset contains text samples labeled as deceptive or genuine.

## 2. Data Analysis

We conducted the following analyses on each dataset: - Number of samples and distribution of deceptive labels - Text length distribution - Word frequency analysis using word clouds - t-SNE visualization for dimensionality reduction

## 3. Comparison Across Datasets

We compared the results of the analyses across the five datasets to identify commonalities and differences in deceptive text patterns.
